Hi! I am Burhan Noman, a User Experience Engineer. I blend knowledge and passion to come up with intuitive and beautifully crafted User Experience. I have a strong empathy with users and never ending love for design and technology. While designing, I embrace ambiguity, I believe in iterations and I think of failures as a design experiments with the opportunity to learn.
