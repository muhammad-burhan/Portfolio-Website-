                <p>
                    We sent out a preliminary survey to gain insight at a larger scale into how often our target
                    users feel lonely and what types of situations perpetuate this feeling.

                    Most of the survey responses were ambiguous and this gave us insight on the preferred terminology
                    used by our audience, and helped us avoid
                    confuse wording of questions during intercepts and interviews.
                </p>

                <h3>Intercepts</h3>
                <p>We conducted 60 intercepts across Savannah to understand the public's current mental model towards
                    art as a medium for self-expression and how their intimate social circles developed.

                    Initially participants were hesitant in answering questions related to loneliness because of the
                    stigma attached to it. But later after some warm-up questions participants were able to open-up.
                    We used these findings and data to scope our interview questions moving forward.

                    Staging 30 min user meet-ups allowed for us to uncover a more in-depth understanding of how each beat
                    of the prompt related to the users’ daily lives.

                    We noticed a commonality that many participants measured a relationship's authenticity by the amount
                    of effort put forth. Yet, many participants expressed how they feared reaching out first due to the risk of
                    rejection.

                    We Learned, our society moves so fast nowadays that relationships have difficulty going past the superficial stage.
                    For meaningful connections, people need to slow down, which is paradoxical: what we need to do is to
                    do less, which is hard in a society that is constantly telling us to do more and faster. Additionally,
                    different people suffers from varying degree of loneliness which affects their behavior.

                    Our research insights led us creating three unique archetypes. Using this, we could create scenarios
                    based on our research, and pinpoint moments in their daily lives in which our app could enhance their
                    experiences and ease their pains.

                <p>
                    Analyzing user needs, likes/dislikes, behavior & motivation we formulated our design principles,
                    which helped us know exactly which user we were designing for.

                <h3>Model for Mitigating Loneliness</h3>
                <p>
                    Our design principles were the culmination of our research. The needs and likes/dislikes of our
                    archetypes (that were created based on our interviews), were complemented and checked against the
                    information of our experts and directed towards areas our competitors were lacking in. These served
                    as our guiding compass when creating our initial wave of concepts.

                <p>
                    This model is not suggesting that a Lone Wolf will become a Social Butterfly, rather we identified
                    how each might begin to form an authentic relationship. Through our research we learned that if a
                    person is suffering from Chronic Loneliness an App might not help him, it is recommended for him to
                    see the consultant for that. Moving forward, we decided to focus more center three steps.

                <p>
                    Based on design principles and user need, we came up with six concepts. After getting feedback from
                    Google Daydream team and analyzing the technological limitations, we decided to proceed with EastAR egg and Geo Grams.

                    This concept allows users to transform their worlds into master paintings. When users scan art,
                    they unlock other artists’ lenses. Users can also share their lenses with friends.

                    our design principles to validate our ideas.

                <p>
                    After defining user tasks, team of UX and interaction designers start visualizing how information should be laid out and how
                    different flows interact with each other.

                <h3>Dividing into sub problems</h3>
                <p>
                    We soon realized that to handle such a complex problem we need to divide it into sub problems and
                    prototype each component separately. We divided the team of UX designers and programmers and assigned
                    them sub problems to quickly prototype and validate.
                </p>

                <h3>Early Sketches</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the information architecture we start sketching wireframes and defining the basic flow of the app.
                    In early wireframes we assumed the creation tool as black box to simplify the flow. Another team of designers and
                    programmers were working on it to test and prototype in parallel.

                            how can we place toolbox in Augmented reality and how user can interact with tools to build his/her
                            creations.

                <h3>Another Iteration</h3>
                <p>
                    From user testing we learned users were not at all comfortable with moving toolbox. We observed users
                    were getting more comfortable in using the Augmented reality toolbelt instead of tool boxes.
                    Moreover, the app flow was really confusing to users. Partially because of the low fidelity of it. Other
                    than that, they were not able to make sense of collaboration on the project and how they are sending
                    their creations to people on the map.
                    After identifying these problems we came up with another set of prototypes and tested it with the users.
                </p>
                <h6>Wireframes 2.0</h6>

                </div>
                <p>
                    In next iteration we detach the collaboration feature from the canvas placement and put the top center
                    of the screen which brings the list of people to collaborate. This facilitate user to invite other
                    people later and start the creation without making a choice. We also combined creation placement on
                    map and sending to a friend on one screen to avoid giving the user better context of what they are
                    supposed to do after working on their creation.

                <p>
                    We also started working on defining the visual guidelines so that we can make sure all the visuals
                    including UI, print and digital assets are consistent.

                        <p>
                            After couple of more iterations we made a hi-fidelity prototypes to get more granular feedback
                            about the specific interactions like how you will move the object, scale it and animate it.
                            Animating an object was another challenge. We tested the prototype in which you will
                            move your phone in exactly the same path you want your object to move. And users loved it!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the implementation phase we never forgot our design principles and was continuously
                            validating our ultimate goal of mitigating the disconnection between users using art!

                            the world to view and react to it. You can get notified if people live-stream works using your art or if your friend
                            starts one, or you can simply search for them using certain filters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After you are done creating your art, you can use the share map to place it anywhere in the world or, conversely,
                            let it sit exactly where you created it for context-dependent art. When placing your art, you can make it public,
                            friends-only or leave it for a specific friend to find, as well as change the settings whether people can save it
                            as an asset or add to it.

                            From the home screen user can access the discovery map where they can view live streams,
                            join open collaboration and look for creations around them.
                            Undiscovered creations are represented by the abstract icons and get replaced by the actual
                            creation once you find it in physical space.

                        <p>
                            Either by notification, tracking through the map or randomly walking up on it, your home screen
                            is your viewfinder into the augmented world of scapes, and lets you find creations others have placed in the world.
                            You can also add onto creations and it will generate a timeline that users can scroll through
                            to see how the art has evolved overtime.

                            After discovering the creations, you can add onto it by jumping directly into the creation tool.
                            Moreover, you can save that creation to your tool belt for future use.

                <p>
                    Design and develop a website that can serve as a documentation for the Google Daydream team. Moreover,
                    website should also give the brief introduction of the Scapes and should also cover the brief design process of the team.
                </p>

                <h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">Initial Layouts</h5>
                <p>
                    Initially I was thinking of dividing the website into two main sections, the product itself and our team
                    story containing multiple videos. But later considering our process and the amount of information
                    I had to display I changed the layout to four pages.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home: </strong>The basic intro of the app and the basic models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scapes: </strong>Detailed explanation of the Google Scapes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process: </strong>Goals, Implementation and insights from each process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Team: </strong>Brief introduction of the individuals in team and their contact information.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="center-img" style="margin-top: 35px;width:100%;">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/google/details/web/web-wire.jpg">
                </div>

                <h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">Sitemap</h5>
                <div class="center-img" style="margin-top: 35px;width:100%;">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/google/details/web/sitemap.png">
                </div>

                <h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">Full Page Layout</h5>
                <p>
                    On the home page, the challenge was to give the brief introduction and also displaying the foundation
                    of Scapes like who the users are, what are the design principles and how it's expected to build authentic
                    relationships. All of this information was causing a long scrolling and the information had to be displayed
                    in the chronological order to make sure viewer knows how we came up with design principles and same was the
                    case with most of the pages. So, I decided to go with the section scroll layout and within each section
                    I used carousals to encapsulate the content. This end up giving two benefits.
                    <br/>
                    1) User can now focus on the one piece of information at a time.
                    <br/>
                    2) The information is not overwhelming, if user wants to know more he/she can use carousal to get more information with in sections.
                </p>
                <div class="center-img" style="width:100%;">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/google/details/web/sketchesweb.jpg">
                </div>

                <h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">Development</h5>
                <p>
                    The website was developed using basic front-end technologies like HTML5, SASS, Flexbox, JavaScript
                    and JQuery. The website is not using any boilerplate or template and everything is written from scratch
                    expect supporting plugins like fullPage.js, owl.carousal etc. This enables developer to have the full
                    control over the layout and styling.
                </p>
