        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Project goals: </strong>Design and develop a responsive storytelling website.
            <br/>
            <strong>Personal goal for the project: </strong>Being a Pakistani, I care about the perception of international
            community towards Pakistan. And when there are hundreds of negative things floating around, I want to
            show the positive image of Pakistan and tell other communities what this country has to offer. I have
            been travelling to different parts of the country and want to leverage my journeys to take viewers into
            the beautiful valleys and introduce the most humble and friendliest people on planet.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Tour North is a storytelling website demonstrating the journey to the North of Pakistan - Gilgit.
            Sounds, videos and images takes user to the amazing valleys and creates a unique audio-visual experience
            to develop a narrative story environment.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="content-container">

            <div style="text-align: center;margin:45px 0;">
                <button class="bn-btn dark" onclick="window.open('http://www.tournorth.com', '_blank')">Launch Experience</button>
            </div>

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was seared for tons of inspirations around the web, looked different layouts and get
                inspirations from those websites. After that I realized that the content is the most important factor in
                storytelling, so I start writing my content and sort images, videos and sound content I intend to display.
                Soon after that I start sketching the layout and ideas.
            </p>

                <img src="img/portfolio/tournorth/detail/sketches.jpg">
            </div>

            <h3>Sound + Visuals</h3>
            <p>
                To create an experience and create a feeling of serenity I used slow instrumental sounds with the
                blend of actual sound of the nature, lakes & valleys.
            </p>

            <h3>Micro Interactions</h3>
            <p>
                While designing I also emphasized on creating micro interactions. This makes web elements looks real
                as they have a life in them and responds back to user as they interact with elements.
            </p>

            <h3>Going with hamburger navigation</h3>
            <p>
                Initially I decided to go with the top fixed navigation, but fixed navigation was always coming in the
                way of 100% width content I intend to display. I also realize that since the website is one page and there
                is no unusual lengthy scroll I can bundle the navigation into hamburger icon. But I believe there is still
                a lot of opportunities for improvement.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>After making above decisions i quickly came up with the basic wireframes to inform Hi-fi mock-ups decisions.</p>
            <div class="grid-images row-two">
                <div class="item"><div><img src="img/portfolio/tournorth/detail/wf1.png"></div></div>
                <div class="item"><div><img src="img/portfolio/tournorth/detail/wf2.png"></div></div>
            </div>

            <h3>Color Palette & Font</h3>
            <p>
                As far as visual design is concerned i decided to go with one color only and rest of the colors will be brought
                by the content itself.
            </p>
            <div class="color-palette">
                <div class="center-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/tournorth/detail/typo.png"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                The website was developed using basic front-end technologies like HTML5, SASS, JavaScript, JQuery and
                Bootstrap framework. The website is responsive and use serve side caching to load resources quickly.
