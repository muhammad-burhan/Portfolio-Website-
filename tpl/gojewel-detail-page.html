        <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Story telling is a fundamental part of design process. Stories help you identify needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Understanding the concept of need and solutions. Needs are permanent, solutions are temporary. Building
                an experience around user need helps in making important design decisions, identify limitations and
                building effective strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
                While designing interfaces, I learned how user perceive what they expect. How designers can leverage
                user’s recognition capability over recalling.
            </li>
            <li>

                    Storytelling is one of the integral parts of needfinding. To find the need of people we start paying attention
                    to small things and start getting deeper in conversations with people in our daily life.
                    After collecting different stories individually, team shared stories with each other and decided to proceed
                    with story which represent the actual need of the people.

                    jewelry shop and one necklace caught her attention. However she doesn’t want to wear the same jewelry at
                    different parties. She might wear that jewelry for one or two times after buying it and the price do not

                    To make it available for bigger audience and increase her earning from luxury jewelry, she started to

                    luxurious jewelries. But after wearing couple of times she tends to loose interest and want something
                    different and new and this makes her collection useless and waste of money.

                    are really hard to sell. This sometimes discourages her to do innovation and set restrictions on her

    <h3>Storytelling through Video</h3>
    <p class="t-a-l">
        There are a lot of different methods to test your idea. And storytelling video is one of them. We kicked off this
        project using stories from people and we tested this idea through story telling. Using the video, we conveyed the
        idea and observe reactions from our audience.
        <br>
        Our personas performed the particular scenario which represents the need
        to wear a jewelry. And the audience watching this video actually perceives the whole idea and the need
        of the people. We omitted all the unnecessary details from story and shoot a video using as limited details as possible
        to observe the validity and test if solution is actually addressing and fulfilling the need.

                    app Jemila can see that the original price is $5800, but rent per day is only $100. Jemila was
