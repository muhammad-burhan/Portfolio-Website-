            <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Story telling is a fundamental part of design process. Stories help you identify needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understanding the concept of need and solutions. Needs are permanent, solutions are temporary. Building
                    an experience around user need helps in making important design decisions, identify limitations and
                    building effective strategies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While designing interfaces, I learned how user perceive what they expect. How designers can leverage
                    user’s recognition capability over recalling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experience economy: Difference between commodities, goods, services and experience. Why designers
                    should strive for experience and aim for transformation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learned different techniques of visual and information design, prototyping and user testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Story telling using video is an effective tool to test your idea and convey message to users. I learned
                    different techniques of storyboarding, direction and production.

                        Storytelling is one of the integral parts of needfinding. To find the need of people we start paying attention
                        to small things and start getting deeper in conversations with people in our daily life.
                        After collecting different stories individually, team shared stories with each other and decided to proceed
                        with story which represent the actual need of the people.

                        jewelry shop and one necklace caught her attention. However she doesn’t want to wear the same jewelry at

                        To make it available for bigger audience and increase her earning from luxury jewelry, she started to

                        luxurious jewelries. But after wearing couple of times she tends to loose interest and want something
                        different and new and this makes her collection useless and waste of money.

            There are a lot of different methods to test your idea. And storytelling video is one of them. We kicked off this
            project using stories from people and we tested this idea through story telling. Using the video, we conveyed the
            idea and observe reactions from our audience.
            <br>
            Our personas performed the particular scenario which represents the need
            to wear a jewelry. And the audience watching this video actually perceives the whole idea and the need
            of the people. We omitted all the unnecessary details from story and shoot a video using as limited details as possible
            to observe the validity and test if solution is actually addressing and fulfilling the need.

                        Lisah saw the shocked face on Jemila and told her about GO JEWELRY app which she used. From this
                        app Jemila can see that the original price is $5800, but rent per day is only $100. Jemila was
                        excited and download the app. She started using this app to rent the jewelry for herself. She places
